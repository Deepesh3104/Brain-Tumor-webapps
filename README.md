# Brain Tumor Web Application

## Overview

The Brain Tumor Web Application is a machine learning-powered platform designed to aid in the detection and classification of brain tumors using MRI images. This web application leverages state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to provide accurate and reliable tumor diagnosis, helping medical professionals make informed decisions.

## Features

- **MRI Image Upload**: Upload MRI images for analysis.
- **Tumor Detection**: Automated detection of brain tumors.
- **Classification**: Classifies tumors into different categories.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of detected tumors.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive user interface for easy navigation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Flask
- OpenCV
- NumPy

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
